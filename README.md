# NFL Passing Touchdown Predictor

## Project Overview
This project utilizes a neural network model to predict the number of passing touchdowns by NFL players in upcoming games. Leveraging historical player and game data provided by NFLVerse, this model aims to provide accurate predictions to help fantasy football players, analysts, and enthusiasts in their decision-making processes.

## Data Source
The data used in this project comes from [NFLVerse](https://github.com/nflverse/nflverse-data/releases?page=2), a comprehensive source of historical NFL data. It includes detailed player performance metrics, game statistics, and other relevant information which are crucial for training our predictive model.

## Model
The core of this project is a neural network designed specifically for time-series forecasting in the context of sports analytics. It takes into account various features such as player historical performance, game conditions, and opposing defenses to predict the number of passing touchdowns.

### Features
- Player historical performance data
- Opposing team defensive rankings
- Game location (home/away)
- Weather conditions
- More (specify any additional features used)

## How to Use
### Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- scikit-learn

## Future Work and Improvements

### Model Refinement
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Implementing grid search or random search to find the optimal hyperparameters for the neural network. This will help improve the accuracy and efficiency of the model.
- **Feature Engineering:** Exploring additional features that can enhance the model's predictive power, such as player injuries, team strategies, or even historical trends during specific weeks of the season.
- **Advanced Algorithms:** Investigating the use of more complex neural network architectures like LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks or GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) networks to better handle the sequential nature of game data.
- **Data Augmentation:** Increasing the dataset by incorporating more seasons or adding derived statistical features to provide the model with more examples and a broader learning scope.

### Predictive Expansion
- **Expanding Predictive Capabilities:** Extending the model to predict not only passing touchdowns but also other key performance indicators such as rushing yards, receptions, or defensive stats. This will make the tool more versatile and useful for a broader audience.
- **Real-Time Predictions:** Developing a system that can offer real-time predictions based on live game data, allowing users to make informed decisions during the games.
- **Player Injury Impact:** Modeling the impact of player injuries on team performance to adjust predictions accordingly, enhancing the model's adaptability to real-world scenarios.

### Integration and Deployment
- **API Development:** Building a RESTful API for the model so that it can be easily integrated with other applications or websites, making the predictions more accessible to users.
- **User Interface:** Creating a user-friendly interface that allows non-technical users to interact with the model, input parameters, and receive predictions without needing to understand the underlying technology.
